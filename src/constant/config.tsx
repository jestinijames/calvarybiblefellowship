        <p>
          We believe that “all Scripture is inspired by God,” by which we
          understand that the sixty-six books of the Bible are a divine product.
          God used a process of dual authorship to provide His written
          revelation to mankind. The Holy Spirit exerted supernatural influence
          on the human authors that, using their own personalities and styles of
          writing, they wrote down precisely what God wanted to give to mankind
          as Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          We believe that the Bible is therefore without any error in the
          original documents, the supreme and complete revelation of God’s will
          for salvation, and the only infallible rule of faith and practice. (2
          Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:21; John 16:13-14; 17:17; Numbers 23:19;
          Psalm 12:6; Hebrews 4:12; 6:18; Matthew 5:18; 24:35)

        infinitely perfect in all His attributes, and eternally existing in
        three Persons – The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. Each Person of
        the Godhead is therefore deserving of the same worship, confidence, and
        obedience. (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Matthew
        28:18-19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; John 1:14; Hebrews 1:1-4; Acts 5:3-4)

          We believe that man was created by God in His image and likeness,
          without sin, to enjoy God’s fellowship, live in His will, and glorify
          Him. Adam and Eve, the historical parents of the entire human race,
          chose to disobey God, and by this sin, lost their original innocence
          and communion with Him.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that, as the head of the human race, Adam’s fall
          became the fall of all of humanity, so that corruption, guilt, death,
          and condemnation belong to everyone born into this world, the Lord
          Jesus Christ being the only exception. All men are thus corrupt by
          nature, enslaved to sin, and incapable of seeking God, apart from
          divine grace. (Genesis 1:27; 2:21-22; 3:1-19; Psalm 14:1-3; Jeremiah
          17:9; Romans 3:10-19; 23; 5:12-19; 8:6-8; Ephesians 2:1-3; 1 Timothy

          We believe that in the fullness of time, God sent forth His eternal
          Son as Jesus the Messiah, conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of
          the virgin Mary. In the incarnation, the Second Person of the Trinity
          took on a sinless human nature, so that the two distinct natures were
          joined together in one Person, without confusion, change, division or
          separation. The Lord Jesus Christ is thus truly God and truly man.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          We also believe that in fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan, Jesus
          Christ voluntarily suffered and died on a cross, was buried, rose from
          the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and is seated at the
          right hand of God the Father as our High Priest and Advocate.
          (Galatians 4:4; Luke 1:30-35; John 1:1-18; 29; 3:16; Philippians
          2:6-8; Hebrews 1:3; 4:15;7:25; 10:5-14; Romans 3:25–26; 1 Peter 3:18;

        <p>
          We believe that Jesus Christ, in His perfect obedience to God the
          Father, died on the cross as our representative and substitute, and
          thus accomplished our redemption. As the all-sufficient sacrifice for
          our sins, He took our punishment, and satisfied the wrath of God
          against us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is
          God’s vindication of His Person and claims, and a sure proof that His
          atoning work on the cross has been accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that on the basis of Jesus Christ’s work on the cross,
          anyone who believes in Him is freed from the punishment of sin,
          declared righteous, given eternal life, and adopted into the family of
          God. The believer, however, retains his sin nature, which cannot be
          expunged in this life. Thus, the believer is to grow in grace, and be
          transformed progressively into the likeness of the Son of God by the
          power of the Holy Spirit.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that the believer will be made perfect when he
          receives the resurrection body at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          We believe that, because of God’s love for His children, because of
          the efficacy of the work of Christ on the cross, because of the
          unceasing intercession and advocacy of Christ in heaven, because of
          God’s faithfulness to His covenants, because of the indwelling
          presence of the Holy Spirit, all who are believers, once saved, shall
          be kept saved by God’s power, and are thus secure in Christ forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that it is the privilege of every child of God to
          enjoy the assurance of their salvation based on the testimony of God
          in His word. The believer, however, is exhorted never to use his
          liberty in Christ as an occasion for sinful living and carnality.
          Rather, the believer is called to a life of separation unto Christ,
          one that exhibits obedience and pursues holiness. (Romans 3:21-25;
          5:9-10; 18-19; 6:15-22; 8:1; 29-30; 13:13-14; 1 Corinthians 15:3; 1

          We believe that the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Trinity,
          whose sovereign actions were seen in creation, the incarnation, the
          written revelation, and salvation, began His work in a new way on the
          day of Pentecost, marking the inauguration of a new era, in
          fulfillment of divine promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that, in this new age, the Spirit glorifies the crucified
          and risen Christ in all that He does. His ministries include
          convicting the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment,
          regenerating sinners, indwelling believers from the moment of
          regeneration, baptizing believers into the one body of Christ, filling
          those yielded to Christ for power and service, illuminating Scripture,
          guiding, equipping and empowering believers for Christ-like living and
          service, and dispensing spiritual gifts to believers for the
          upbuilding of the body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe that certain gifts of the Holy Spirit such as speaking
          in tongues and miracles were temporary, and primarily intended for the
          initial days of the church. Their purpose was to direct attention to
          and validate the apostles as revealers of God’s word.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          We believe, however, that while the miraculous gifts were temporary,
          God does manifest Himself through the miraculous from time to time in
          accordance with His sovereign purposes.(Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians
          12:12; 13:14; Genesis 1:2; Matthew 1:18; 2 Peter 1:20-21; John 3:5-7;

        We believe in the one universal church, whose Head is the Lord Jesus
        Christ, and comprises all those who are united to Him by faith. This
        universal church finds its expression in local churches where believers
        are taught God’s word, engage in corporate worship, practice the
        ordinances of baptism and Lord’s supper, build each other’s faith
        through the use of spiritual gifts, hold each other accountable, submit
        to leadership, serve each other in love, and engage in local and world

      <p>
        We believe that, in the eschatological program of God, the next great
        event is the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the air, before the
        seven-year tribulation period, to receive into heaven all who belong to
        Him, both those who are alive at His coming and those who have fallen
        asleep in Him. This event is presented in Scripture as our blessed hope
        for which we should be constantly looking. We believe that at the end of
        the tribulation period, the Lord Jesus Christ will return with power and
        great glory to set up the millennial kingdom when God’s covenant
        promises will be realized for the nation of Israel as she is restored to
        her own land, and the whole world will be brought to the knowledge of
        God. This period of thousand years will be followed by the final
        judgment of all unbelievers at the great white throne of Christ. There
        they will be condemned to an eternal conscious punishment in the lake of
        fire. We also believe that the believers will enjoy eternal blessedness
        with the Lord in the new heaven and the new earth, to the praise of His
        glorious grace. (John 14:1-3; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52; Philippians 3:20;
